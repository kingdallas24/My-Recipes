        <h2 class="headingTwo">Not New York Style</h2>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            New York pizza is the most famous pizza in the world and for good
            reason! However, we shouldn't underestimate some of the other styles
            out there in the world. I've had pizza everywhere I've traveled to.
            Strangely enough I've had pizza in every country I've traveled to.
            To be honest it's hard to say which pizza was the absolute best. In
            my mind, I want to say New York, because that's something they have
            so much pride in. for my personally, I've just come to appreciate
            all styles of pizza, and I don't necessarily believe that one place
            is necessarily superior than the other. It's case by case.
          </p>
          <p>
            One pizza I wasn't familiar with when I lived in Texas was Detroit
            style pizza. It's kind of like a deep-dish pizza, but in a square
            shape. The nice thing about it, is the edges get really crispy.
            Honestly, when I was in Korea this was probably one of the best
            pizzas I ate. Maybe some of you are like me and have never even
            tried detroit style pizza. Don't sleep on it, it is delicious. While
            this recipe might take a bit of work, the end result will be worth
            it! Please give this recipe a try, I'm sure you will love it!

          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Position an oven rack in the bottom of the oven and preheat to the
              highest temperature setting, 500 to 550 degrees F.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the oil in a large, square metal cake pan (or, ideally, an
              authentic Detroit-style pizza pan). Put the Pizza Dough in the pan
              and gently stretch it out to fit so the dough reaches the corners.
              If the dough is being temperamental, set it aside for another 10
              minutes to relax and try again.
            </li>
            <li>
              Layer the pepperoni on the dough. Then lay the cheese cubes all
              over, especially around the perimeter up to the edge of the pan
              (this creates the coveted crispy cheese crust). Dollop the pizza
              sauce on top in 3 lines.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake in the ultra-hot oven until bubbly and golden and a crispy
              cheese crust has formed, 10 to 15 minutes. Using a fish spatula,
              loosen up the edges and place on a cutting board. Slice into
              squares and serve!
            </li>
            <li>
              Put the flour, salt, yeast and sugar in a food processor with a
              metal blade attachment and pulse to combine. Add 1 cup warm water,
              then process until a ball forms, about 30 seconds (if a ball does
              not form, add a bit more flour). Process for another 30 seconds,
              then roll into a tight ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl.
              Proof in a warm spot until the dough doubles in size, about 2
              hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat a small saucepot over medium heat and add the oil. Add the
              Italian seasoning and garlic and saute until fragrant; do not let
              the garlic burn. Add the tomatoes and sugar and season with salt
              and pepper. Bring to a simmer and simmer until concentrated, about
              30 minutes. Set aside to cool.
