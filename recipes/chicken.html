          <p>
            When I first moved to Korea way back when, I noticed there was a
            lack of good chicken wings restaurants around Seoul. Don't get my
            wrong, Korea has some of the best fried chicken in the world, but
            when it came to classic American style chicken wings they were no
            where to be found!
          </p>
          <p>
            This all changed one day when my South African co-worker told me
            about a restaurant in Itaewon called Philies. He said, "Bro, these
            are exactly like the American style wings you've been talking
            about!" Not only that, but every Thursday they had a special going
            on 10 wings for 5000 won! 5000 won is equivalent to about 4 USD!
          </p>

          <p>
            Needless to say I became a regular when it came to wing Thursday.
            Beers and delicious wings for cheap, you can't beat it! While I was
            there I came across a new flavor of wing, that my coworker swore by.
            Jalapeno cream cheese. I was a traditional hot wing and lemon pepper
            guy, but when I tried these wings, I became instantly hooked!
          </p>

          <p>
            I am back in America now and I can't seem to find these wings at any
            of the local places. So lucky for you, I found the recipe online!
            Please do try this recipe out, I guarantee you won't regret it!

          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Preheat oven to 450F. Line baking sheet with a Cooking Sheet. Add
              chicken wings; season with salt and pepper. Place chicken so it is
              skin side down first.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake in oven for 20 minutes. Flip, and bake for another 20
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add bacon and cook
              for a few minutes. Stir in butter. When melted, add garlic,
              jalapeno, and flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 5-7 minutes,
              or until the roux has browned in color.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add in milk, cream cheese, mustard, cumin, and parpika. Whisk,
              stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and comes to a
              boil. Stir in cheddar cheese and cook until desired thickness is
              achieved. Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Toss sauce with chicken wings OR place sauce on the side to dip
              your chicken wings into.
            </li>
          </ol>
