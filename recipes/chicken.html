            <h2>My Favorite Wings</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>When I first moved to Korea way back when, I noticed there was a lack of good chicken wings
                    restaurants
                    around Seoul. Don't get my wrong, Korea has some of the best fried chicken in the world, but when it
                    came to classic American style chicken wings they were no where to be found!</p>
                <p>This all changed one day when my South African co-worker told me about a restaurant in Itaewon called
                    Philies. He said, "Bro, these are exactly like the American style wings you've been talking about!"
                    Not
                    only that, but every Thursday they had a special going on 10 wings for 5000 won! 5000 won is
                    equivalent
                    to about 4 USD! </p>
                <p>Needless to say I became a regular when it came to wing Thursdays. Beers and delicous wings for
                    cheap,
                    you can't beat it! While I was there I came accross a new flavor of wing, that my coworker swore by.
                    Jalapeno cream cheese.. I was a traditional hot wing and lemon pepper guy, but when I tried these
                    wings,
                    I became instantly hooked!</p>
                <p>I am back in America now and I can't seem to find these wings at any of the local places. So lucky
                    for
                    you, I found the recipe online! Please do try this recipe out, I guarantee you won't regret it!</p>

                    <li>Preheat oven to 450F. Line baking sheet with a Cooking Sheet. Add chicken wings; season with
                        salt
                        and
                        pepper. Place chicken so it is skin side down first.</li>
                    <li>Bake in oven for 20 minutes. Flip, and bake for another 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Place medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add bacon and cook for a few minutes. Stir in
                        butter.
                        When
                        melted, add garlic, jalapeno, and flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 5-7 minutes, or until
                        the
                        roux

                        thickens and comes to a boil. Stir in cheddar cheese and cook until desired thickness is
                        achieved.
                        Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Toss sauce with chicken wings OR place sauce on the side to dip your chicken wings into.</li>
